# Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5 14" (14APH8) 120Hz Linux fix

Recently I got this laptop with 120hz 2880x1800 screen, but in Linux I could only select 60Hz. Windows did work with 120Hz out-of-the-box. I've set up this repo to share the problem description and provide a fix for this laptop with Linux.

## Does this fix apply to me?

Check the kernel log by executing `dmesg`. If it contains `[drm] DisplayID checksum invalid, remainder is 248`, you are probably affected by the same bug as me (see [Problem description](#problem-description)).

Note that the provided fixed EDID in this repository only applies to this laptop's screen model; you have to fix your own EDID if you encounter the same error with a different model. 

## Fix

As root:
1. Create a directory `/lib/firmware/edid/`.
2. Copy the fixed EDID `edid.bin` from this repository to `/lib/firmware/edid/`.
3. Ensure the fixed EDID gets included in your initramfs.
   - For Debian and derivatives, you can use the `debian/edid-firmware` initramfs hook from this repo: copy it to `/etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/`.
   - For Arch and derivatives, you can use the `arch/edid-firmware` mkinitcpio hook from this repo: copy it to `/etc/initcpio/install/edid-firmware`. Then, add `edid-firmware` to the `HOOKS` section in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`.
   - For Fedora this is handled by Dracut. Add `fedora/00-lenovo-14aph8-edid.conf` to `/etc/dracut/conf.d/`.
4. Recreate your initramfs.
   - Debian: run `update-initramfs -c -k all`.
   - Arch: run `mkinitcpio --allpresets`.
   - Fedora: run `sudo dracut -f`.
5. Modify your kernel command line to use the fixed EDID by including `drm.edid_firmware=eDP-1:edid/edid.bin`. If you use GRUB as your bootloader, add this command to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` in `/etc/default/grub` and then update your GRUB configuration file:
   - Debian: run `update-grub`.
   - Arch: run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`.
   - Fedora: run `sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg`.
6. Reboot and verify you now have 120hz:

## Problem description

Modern display devices ship with a so-called [EDID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data) (Extended Display Identification Data) that describe the capabilities of the device, such as resolutions and refresh rates. It is a standard published by the VESA organization. The basic structure of the EDID has some limitations though, e.g. the maximum stored pixel clock, which influences the refresh rate among other properties, can be 655.35 MHz at most. To overcome this, VESA published 'extension blocks' that can describe display modes beyond the limitations of the basic structure. This laptop's 2880x1800 @ 120Hz display mode is described in such an extension block, to be precise in a [DisplayID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayID) 1.3 extension block.

The extension block is verified by a checksum calculation so the driver can check if the block isn't corrupt. Unfortunately, this checksum is invalid, causing the 2880x1800 @ 120Hz mode to be disregarded in Linux, hence the `[drm] DisplayID checksum invalid, remainder is 248` error in your kernel log.

The problem can be fixed by overriding the built-in EDID with a fixed one, which is provided in this repository. It is crafted as follows:
1. Extract the original EDID: `cat /sys/class/drm/card0-eDP-1/edid > edid.original.bin`
2. Inspect the EDID with an hexdump: `hexdump -vC edid.original.bin`. The EDID is 256bytes big, of which the last 128 bytes are the extension block. The first two bytes of the extension block contain header identifiers, the last two bytes can be used to influence checksum calculation:

3. Recalculate the checksum of the DiplayID extension block and then the surrounding extension block, and optionally fix the DisplayID magic value from 0x13 to 0x12:
